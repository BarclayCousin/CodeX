=====================

a work-in-progress simple javascript calculator


Creating this calculator was a practice exercise in JavaScript, guided by a tutorial on Codeacademy. After a refactoring, the calculator uses cleaner variables and functions, but does not yet take decimal numbers as inputs or display rounded decimals. I'll be working on these features in future iterations. 

The calculator's design and coded styles are my originals.
