              different phases of care, there is an increase in cost. Usually,
              the max amount spent is between £4,000 - £4,500. The year these
              statistics were taken, were in 2020 so could differ to the current

              This graph talks about prostate cancer, and how through different

              shows the statistics for males of all ages. As you can see, the
              cost can range from £12,990 to £14,200. Again the year these
              statistics were recorded were in 2014 so could potentially differ
              from the current date.

              £1,200 to £1,600. The year this stastic was recorded differs from
              the current year, so the cost may be different to what it was

              in. This is a statistic from 2012, so the current treatment cost
              may differ. Furthermore, the severity of the condition may play a

              from 2011 so the treatment cost can be different from the current

              as well as the condition. The more risky the treatment is, the
              more likely there will be an increase in cost. These are stastics
              from different years, here to give you an idea of what the cost
